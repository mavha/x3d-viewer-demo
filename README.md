### X3D Viewer Example

This is a standard ReactJS web application. In order to run it locally you should run these steps

1.	`git clone git@bitbucket.org:elad3d/x3d-examples-and-uecases.git`
2.	`cd x3d-examples-and-uecases`
3.	`npm install`
4.	`npm start`
5. 	Open localhost:3000 in your WebGL-enabled browser

## Component interface
- The X3D Viewer component will receive 4 props as input
	- conf: this is the parsed JSON file (defined below)
	- clickHandler: the handler for the click event
	- mouseoverHandler: the handler for the mouseover event
	- mouseoutHandler: the handler for the mouseout event

\* _All events receive a payload obj including the targeted Shape and it's own errors. Targeted Shape elements are only those which are referenced by errors in the json file_

Payload definition:

```
	{	
		id: string, 
		color: string, // rgb 256 css format
		errors: 
			{
				errorId: string,
				name: string, 
				description: string, 
				visible: boolean
			}[]
	}
```


Example:

```

const clickHandler = useCallback(
	(payload) => {
		setActive(payload);
	},[]
)

(...)

<MyX3DViewer 
	conf={conf} 
	mouseoutHandler={mouseoutHandler}
	mouseoverHandler={mouseoverHandler}
	clickHandler={clickHandler}></MyX3DViewer>

```

#### X3D Object specifications
- Objects must be formed by Shape elements. 
- Each Shape must include the Material element within this path: Shape>Appearance>Material, in order to get "painted" by errors.
- Shapes are identified by the DEF attribute

##### X3D Object File - Content Example

```

#### JSON Conf specifications
- The configuration file must contain a URL pointing to .x3d file including (if necessary) APP TOKEN as query or path param.
- The component expects all the file info as a JSON Object, not the file itself
- In order to hide/show errors dinamically, the conf object parsed from the file must be updated for the component to refresh shape colors
- The configuration is also expected to have a `showAxis` flag in order to toggle the axis visibility
- For the rendered object to be viewed in different positions, a list of viewpoints should be provided to the component, which will show a list of options for the user to choose

#### JSON Conf Error lines
- In each error/message line of the file, the visible attribute indicated whether the shape gets painted or not
- Each line may point to one or more *Shapes*, referencing them with the correspondent DEF atribute within the ids value.
- When a Shape is referenced by more than one visible error item, colors are calculared as average using each RGB value.

##### JSON Configuration - expected format

```

{
	"id": string,
	"url": string,
	"showXYZ": boolean,
	"boundingBox": {
		"xmin": number, 
		"xmax": number,

##### JSON Configuration Loading

The JSON object that contains all the configuration indicated in this file can be loaded from different king of resources. 
JSON Files, RestAPI endpoints, programaticaly or any other way, after retrieving the necessary info, the format must comply with these specifications.

For example:

```
	// Loading from file
	const jsonConf = await fetch("example.json");
	const confObj = await jsonConf.json();
```
```
	// Loading from rest api
	const jsonConf = await fetch("https://3dcastor.com/x3d/models/1/conf");
	const confObj = await jsonConf.json();
```
```
	//Programatically creating the Configuration Object
	const confObj = {};
	confObj.id = "some id";
	confObj.url = "https://3dcastor.com/x3d/models/1?app_token=APsda9s8usanA79sA";
	confObj.cog = {
        "x": 14,
        "y": -43,
        "z": 0
    };
	(...)
```
